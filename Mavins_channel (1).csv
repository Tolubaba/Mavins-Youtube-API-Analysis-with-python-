**LYRICS**
My denim faded but I rock it like a baby in a cot
I put water in the ocean in the city that I'm from
I light the room in the dark cause my bling is a torch
I watched fashion die today in the mirror that I saw

Shebi na to ball we go ball - flex to the dawn
I go settle the funds - no return
And when I enter the club
No dey my front
‘Cause me I get gun o
No dey do me wrong 

[Chorus]
Oh I’m a fashion killa
I got much delivered 
When I pass you shiver
And my ass got thicker 
Oh I’m a fashion killa
I got much delivered 
When I pass you shiver
And my ass got thicker 

[Verse 2]
Image. 
Picture a chandelier on my head 
I see the diamonds wet everywhere 
I know you see me drenched in finesse (in finesse)
Oh reason
Think of it a brown shirt and no ribbon
Diamonds awaken everytime that I need it 
Babushka on everything my allegiance [my allegiance]

[Chorus]
Oh I’m a fashion killa
I got much delivered 
When I pass you shiver
And my ass got thicker 

 I’m a fashion killa
I got much delivered 
When I pass you shiver
And my ass got thicker 

Oh I’m a fashion killa
I got much delivered 
When I pass you shiver
And my ass got thicker 

I’m a fashion killa
I got much delivered 
When I pass you shiver
And my ass got thicker 

Fashion girl 
Always wavy 
Fashion girl never changing",2021-08-05 23:08:30,869321,11251,0,193,PT2M59S,sd,false,1900-01-01 23:08:30,2021,August,Thursday,2021-08-05,179.0

LYRICS
Open your life 
Open your canter sip from your  bottle and vibe
No dey dull my guy 
Or e go pass you by 
Open your eyes 
They don’t care about you 
And when you die 
They will cry but live like you weren’t alive

Lyrics:
[Intro]
I’m feeling vibes on vibes 
I'm a ticking dynamite
I’ll blow your candle light
You know i'm just that type 
No oh dem no fit kill my vibe
Dem no fit kill my vibe 
Dem no fit kill, dem no fit kill, dem no fit kill my

[Verse 1]
A wise man said follow the stars 
There you shall find a piece of advice
If you hate your enemies
Enemies shine 
If you’re not a friend of me 
Enter the light
‘Cause you can never kill my vibe
Got here with no sacrifices
Everything once taken
Still had to make it
Vibe killer, me I no go take shit 

[Chorus]
Vibe killer
Bloody samaritan
Protect my energy from your bad aura 
Na my pastor say I be my healer
Everything I desire
I go receive
My rhythm
Flow like a river
If you get yawa
Come on go and sit down
I go just para 
Comot my jigga
I go just dey
Follow my dreams

[Verse 2]
I see you watching my stories
I see you gaging my lifestyle 
I see you watching my movement
This bad bitch bad every day
I no dey look your face
Bad man bad everyday
Get on your knees and pray
Till you regain your faith

[Chorus]
Eh Vibe killer
Bloody samaritan
Protect my energy from your bad aura 
Na my pastor say I be my healer

Taking the piss the only time I can’t aim

Living every minute to the full coz I could die 
Pull up at the spot open doors and it’s suicide

**Lyrics**

Verse 1
Noticed the stars in the sky were lost
No it's not me it’s just the place I was born
I thought this world was sane enough
It’s hard being the dirt

Hook :
I disobeyed
I taught you better
My mama yelled
Omomi wa da
Your child is changing
She started drinking
She’s doing drugs now
To end this feelings
Verse 2
She don dey do runs girl
She’s a bit shy God have mercy
Smoke a little Indian hem
Or se igbo labi
She’s still your baby
Nothing has changed please
She’s only aging
Peer pressure bad ni
Loving ties
Scary fight
All we know is loving people we don’t like
Just to vibe
Then we end up drinking liquor
In the night
With a smile
claiming that we satisfied
with all this fights
punches everywhere
like it's Christmas light
Hook:
I disobeyed
I taught you better
My mama yelled
Omomi wa da

Your boy is changing
he started drinking
he’s doing drugs now
To end this feelings
Bridge:
He’s a diamond in the rough
Now he’s just playing with a gun
Does he go to school anymore
Or is he the king of his cult
Hook:
Cause i disobeyed
I thought you better

Omomi wa da
Your child is changing
they started drinking
He’s doing drugs now

Hip Hop, Drill, EDM
Always killing shit on Afrobeats
Niggaz tryna raise the BPM
I’m trying to raise the GDP
Yeah, I’m talking in per capita
Rap Messiah, saving Africa
Bearing all the crossfire still an all-timer in the shooting caliber

Oya welcome to the zoo,
Irrelevant meetings on Zoom
Debating how so and so might be the G.O.A.T 
When it’s me that’s the elephant up in the room

RIP Woo
Omo e don do
Money by the bundle
You want war better make it art Sun Tzu Hit ‘em with the sonic boom

Right down to the after life
Asshole talk to me nice
Think it’s funny killing rappers seems to be the only way of keeping rap alive
“But you knew that” it’s a rapper life
LADIPOE that’s a copyright
Pardon me on looking down on niggaz having conversations at your proper height

Okay okay
Abi werey dey disguise
E so fun wan soro soke
But it’s okay
As we pull up in the ride
We dey go block Admiralty Way No be today

Dunno why you rewrite verses soon as I jump on it 
Maybe coz every time I spit lines I put my life on it Ladipoe
Take my advice on it
Ego and pride on it
Can’t put a price, value or size on it I’m ready to die fo this
Peter Rufai in a shirt and tie Protecting the goal is a 9 to 5
My résumé long as the number pi 
Circle smaller than the dot on 
I I’m a fucking vibe!
Up close no quotes
Way too blunt and cutthroat

ON GOD!!

It’s hard being the di t r

Verse 2
She don dey do runs girl
She’s a bit shy God have mercy
Smoke a little Indian hem
Or se igbo labi
She’s still your baby
Nothing has changed please
She’s only aging
Peer pressure bad ni
Loving ties
Scary fight
All we know is loving people we don’t like
Just to vibe
Then we end up drinking liquor
In the night
With a smile
claiming that we satisfied
with all this fights
punches everywhere
like it's Christmas light

He’s a diamond in the rough
Now he’s just playing with a gun
Does he go to school anymore
Or is he the king of his cult

Deep in my soul
I walk the wire, to the end

Watch me shine through tinted rovers
Then Shut the game down like changing over!

You ain't gonna chain me, no one can hold me down

Intro
Paiya olalon
London

Verse 1
Sipping on life at the liquor bar
I see you at the corner
Are you alone tonight
Has anybody told you that you look so nice
Or am i the first guy
Oh baby I'm loving your style
Let me buy your drink for the night
Spend all my money on ya
Get you rings that you didn't have
So let's go to the time when you answer me yea
Cos it's cold in the dark

Chorus 1
Do you need some company girl
Oh hey mystery girl
What you doing all alone there
Oh hey mystery girl
Oh hey mystery girl
Oh hey mystery girl
What do I have to do to know your history girl?

Verse 2
I'm sitting in the dark at the busy bar
You at the corner
You're alone again tonight
Huh, I guess he doesn't tell you that you look so nice
He's not a nice guy
All these drinks making you fly
Step on the dance floor
You don't wanna be my odo
I see the lonely in your eyes
Come on let me make your night
So let's got to the time when you answer me yea
Cos it's cold in the dark

Chorus 2
Do you need some company girl
Oh hey mystery girl
What you doing all alone there
Oh hey mystery girl
Oh hey mystery girl
Oh hey mystery girl
What do I have to do to know your history girl?

Lyrics:
Come get that summer vibe 
Welcome to my city in December time 
Generator sounding like a lullaby 
Feeling like a Yoruba Samurai 
Baby I’ll go to war for ya

We burning like candlelight
You can’t even measure it Fahrenheit  
Even if I see you in another life 
Baby, I’ll go to war for ya

See I no go fit lie say, my love for you I swear e sure gan 
Girl you dey blow my mind, you dey blow me away like say you be shotgun 
No lies, you are just my type omoge
No lie, no be lie girl you are just my type omoge

You‘re a killer without a gun 
With you I shine brighter than half of a yellow sun 
You know I studied chemistry, still I can do the math 
Two bodies and one soul is it what you and I have become 

Rest in peace your spirit of jealousy 
Did you kill it just to prove to me love is a felony 
You should write a book on changing a bad boy 
Who still like his holy water with some Hennesy 

Yeah 
She said 
She said I beg your pardon 
The way she back it up on I swear to god you think she good at parking 
You’re the only flower in my garden 
Need the water, the sun plus the summer vibe   

Welcome to my city in December time 
Generator sounding like a lullaby 
Feeling like a Yoruba Samurai 
Baby I’ll go to war for ya

We burning like candle light
You can’t even measure it Fahrenheit  
Even if I see you in another life 
Baby I’ll go to war for ya

See I no go fit lie say, my love for you I swear e sure gan 
Girl you dey blow my mind, you dey blow me away like say you be shotgun 
No lies, you are just my type omoge
No lie, no be lie girl you are just my type omoge

I have a promise to keep
Hold you down everyday in a world where there’s no gravity
Hold you close and bring back the time that we had the summer vibe

Summer vibe
Summer vibe 

Welcome to my city in December time 

December time
December time
December time

Generator sounding like a lullaby 

Lullaby
Lullaby yeah 

Feeling like a Yoruba Samurai 

Samurai ah ah ah ay 

Baby I’ll go to war for ya

See I no go fit lie say my love for you I swear e sure gan 
Girl you dey blow my mind, you dey blow me away like say you be shotgun 
No lies, you are just my type omoge
No lie, no be lie girl you are just my type omoge

Yo 

Your sugar mummy on my case like Teni 
I hate the jealousy, but love the envy  
All eyes on me I feel like Makaveli  
You on this wave then raise your hand and lemme know 

Your sugar mummy on my case like Teni 
I hate the jealousy, but love the envy  
All eyes on me I feel like Makaveli  
You on this wave then raise your hand and lemme know 

Yo
Ladies you don’t have to pretend 
So many of you in the DM 
Guessing some of them they must be maid of honors how I’m booking weddings every weekend 

Spending 9 to 5
At the traffic light 
People no dey really see the sacrifice 
Still they judging who you put the booty on 
Abeg back it up with every kilobyte

I know  
I’m just trying to break the cycle 
I’m playmaker for my life goals 
Things ain’t sliding back, they ain’t black and white, they ain’t half as bad as Micheal 

We got gang gang gang 
Femi kuti we bang bang bang 
Fire bender like Ang Ang Ang 
Now we laughing to the bank bank bank bank 

We no dey recognize face 
You can never stop our drive you’re using second hand brake
Every pastor that I meet just wants to give me handshake 
How I turned one unbeliever into my current fanbase 

Like
Oh by the way 
They owe me something from the budget of the Ministry Of Works coz I’m paving the way 
A superhero has to really know his worth before he ever thinks of saving the day 
Please be careful when you spelling my name
All in capital when in ABJ
I think we really need a bigger display 
Hol’ Up!
Hol’ Up!

Your sugar mummy on my case like Teni

(yah)
(remix)

Aye
Lemme know 
Take you fifty floors up in my condo 
Ye 
how we go ooh
How we go
Catching flights from Lagos down to Monaco 
Wo oh ooh 
Where the ballers dey 
Omo where the men dey 
Doing 95 from Lekki straight to Mende
Ye!
Omo dey your dey 
(Dey your dey)
Say make I dey my dey 
(Make I dey my dey)
Coz I’m motherfucking coal like am Wande
Wande ay ay ay 

Your sugar mummy on my case like Teni 
I hate the jealousy, but love the envy  
All eyes on me I feel like Makaveli  
You on this wave then raise your hand and lemme know 

Your sugar mummy on my case like Teni 
I hate the jealousy, but love the envy  
All eyes on me I feel like Makaveli  
You on this wave then raise your hand and lemme know 

We give dem Opebi, Magodo, and Lekki 
Like 3 of the phases 
Then give dem Gbagada, Omole and Yaba  
on different occasions 
Then give them Surulere on a late night 
Just because the turn up no dey stop if they should take light 

Where the ballers dey 
Omo where the men dey 
Doing 95 from Lekki straight to Mende
Ye!
Omo dey your dey 
(Dey your dey)
Say make I dey my dey

Yo 

Your sugar mummy on my case like Teni 
I hate the jealousy, but love the envy  
All eyes on me I feel like Makaveli  
You on this wave then raise your hand and lemme know 

Your sugar mummy on my case like Teni 
I hate the jealousy, but love the envy  
All eyes on me I feel like Makaveli  
You on this wave then raise your hand and lemme know 

Yo
Ladies you don’t have to pretend 
So many of you in the DM 
Guessing some of them they must be maid of honors how I’m booking weddings every weekend 

Spending 9 to 5
At the traffic light 
People no dey really see the sacrifice 
Still they judging who you put the booty on 
Abeg back it up with every kilobyte

I know  
I’m just trying to break the cycle 
I’m playmaker for my life goals 
Things ain’t sliding back, they ain’t black and white, they ain’t half as bad as Micheal 

We got gang gang gang 
Femi kuti we bang bang bang 
Fire bender like Ang Ang Ang 
Now we laughing to the bank bank bank bank 

We no dey recognize face 
You can never stop our drive you’re using second hand brake
Every pastor that I meet just wants to give me handshake 
How I turned one unbeliever into my current fanbase 

Like
Oh by the way 
They owe me something from the budget of the Ministry Of Works coz I’m paving the way 
A superhero has to really know his worth before he ever thinks of saving the day 
Please be careful when you spelling my name
All in capital when in ABJ
I think we really need a bigger display 
Hol’ Up!
Hol’ Up!

Your sugar mummy on my case like Teni

(yah)
(remix)

Aye
Lemme know 
Take you fifty floors up in my condo 
Ye 
how we go ooh
How we go
Catching flights from Lagos down to Monaco 
Wo oh ooh 
Where the ballers dey 
Omo where the men dey 
Doing 95 from Lekki straight to Mende
Ye!
Omo dey your dey 
(Dey your dey)
Say make I dey my dey 
(Make I dey my dey)
Coz I’m motherfucking coal like am Wande
Wande ay ay ay 

Your sugar mummy on my case like Teni 
I hate the jealousy, but love the envy  
All eyes on me I feel like Makaveli  
You on this wave then raise your hand and lemme know 

Your sugar mummy on my case like Teni 
I hate the jealousy, but love the envy  
All eyes on me I feel like Makaveli  
You on this wave then raise your hand and lemme know 

We give dem Opebi, Magodo, and Lekki 
Like 3 of the phases 
Then give dem Gbagada, Omole and Yaba  
on different occasions 
Then give them Surulere on a late night 
Just because the turn up no dey stop if they should take light 

Where the ballers dey 
Omo where the men dey 
Doing 95 from Lekki straight to Mende
Ye!
Omo dey your dey 
(Dey your dey)
Say make I dey my dey 
(Make I dey my dey)
Coz I’m motherfucking coal like am Wande
Wande ay ay ay 

Oh yeah 

Your sugar mummy on my case like Teni 
I hate the jealousy, but love the envy  
All eyes on me I feel like Makaveli  
You on this wave then raise your hand and lemme know 

Your sugar mummy on my case like Teni 
I hate the jealousy, but love the envy  
All eyes on me I feel like Makaveli  
You on this wave then raise your hand and lemme know 

Gah damn

Do I believe that we have met, maybe not in this life 
Time’s frozen for a second so I'm thinking tonight 
We break the ice, or better still we can set it aside
Temporarily, my temperature is telling me that you got me so hot stop girl there is no remedy I 
But you don't know me well enough to reply 
And I don't really know you that well 
 
It's funny, you have something in your teeth, but would you try to stop me if I want to take it out, coz you don't know me properly 
Girl, I think you lovely, but you turn this bad boy into a busy body
 
I see you're to busy for me (yeah right)
Or maybe I'm just busy forming (nah)

But I don’t really know you that well

I really wanna tell you how my day went

But I don't really know you that well
 
I really wanna kiss you in the face babe 
(In the face baby) 
And maybe every other place baby
E be like say I no remember say I
Say I no really know u that well
 
Aye-Aye
 
We can go there if you

Aye-Aye
 
We can go there if you 
(if I)
Want to, but me I don't know 
(Oh no)
Why I think I love you
When I don't really know you that well
 
I'm too polite to insult your intelligence why? 
Do I believe that we have met, maybe not in this life 
Time’s frozen for a second so I'm thinking tonight 
We break the ice, or better still we can set it aside
Temporarily, my temperature is telling me that you got me so hot stop girl there is no remedy I 
But you don't know me well enough to reply 
And I don't really know you that well 
 
It's funny, you have something in your teeth, but would you try to stop me if I want to take it out, coz you don't know me properly 
Girl, I think you lovely, but you turn this bad boy into a busy body
 
I see you're to busy for me (yeah right)
Or maybe I'm just busy forming (nah)
Will you call me
When you're ready for me 
It's crazy baby 
How I don't care at all 
That I don't really know you that well 
 
I really wanna tell you how my day went
(How my day went) 
Really want to spend the weekend
(Babe)

Want to, but me I don't know 
(Oh no)
Why I think I love you
When I don't really know you that well 
 
So you be my controller 
See me see this paroller
I just wanna come home to you 
Spend every night telling bad jokes to you
 
Be my boyfriend 
I’ll be up in my boyfriend jeans 
Have a baby with my boyfriend genes 
If you were my boyfriend I’ll be up in my boyfriend dreams 
But I don’t really know you that well 
 
I wanna grow old with you
Do this life with you 
Ride or die for you 
But I don’t really know you that well 
 
I really wanna tell you how my day went
(How my day went)
Really want to spend the weekend
(Babe)

Lyrics:
I’ll fail you 
Don’t give your heart to me I’m no good 
You’re pure and simple but I’m full of shit 
I love me single only fools commit
Yea

And you’re one of a kind 
So many people wish you were the girl in their lives 
I’ll be crazy not to be queuing in line yea
But just before you decide I need to tell you

I’m that is there something better guy
I’m never Mr Right 
Olakunle might be your type 
I’m that is there something better guy 

I feel you 
You see much deeper than my issues 
Got me believing that I can trust again 
I guess that’s the first step to find true love again, yea

And you’re one of a kind 
So many people wish you were the girl in their lives 
I’ll be crazy not to be queuing in line yea
But just before you decide I need to tell you

I’m that is there something better guy
I’m never Mr Right 
Olakunle might be your type 
I’m that is there something better guy 

But I need your love 
I need your love 
Oh I need your love 
(Deep down I know that girl I need your love)
I need your love 
Oh I need your love 
I need your love 

Are you not scared I might 
Not be worth the fight 
All the times I didn’t believe 
Girl you made me see 

That I need your love 
I need your love 
Oh I need your love 
(You got me running running running back to your love oh yea)
Need your love 
Oh girl I need your love 
(And I fit be your guy)

Oh girl I need your love 
Oh I need your love 
You got me running running running back to your love

You’re not scared I might not be worth the fight 
God will punish those who lie 
Cos girl you make me see
I’m that something better guy

Papa Lyrics:
Papa
He calls me to pray
He tells the Lord 
To watch over me 
Oh my papa 
He can like to say 
As you go away
Don’t forget where you came 
 
If you lose your way you can pray 
Don’t be afraid don’t lose faith
You will find your help there’ll be a way 
Just remember to pray and you’ll be ok 
 
Papa
He calls everyday 
He asks me son 
I hope you’re doing okay 
Oh my papa
He too dey fear say I gho go astray 
Cos I walk a stranger land 
And my home is so far away 
 
Papa says if you lose your way you can pray 
Don’t be afraid don’t lose faith
You will find your help there’ll be a way 
Just remember to pray and you’ll be ok 
 
Me sef dey pray for Papa 
Make him find more strength and grace 
And may the good Lord keep him longer 
In Jesus name.
 
If you lose your way you can pray 
Don’t be afraid don’t lose faith
You will find your help there’ll be a way 
Just remember to pray
 
If you lose your way you can pray 
Don’t be afraid don’t lose faith
You will find your help there’ll be a way 
Just remember to pray and you’ll be ok 
You can pray 
Don’t be afraid don’t lose faith
You will find your help there’ll be a way 
If you remember to pray

-tGAJY4R6uc,MavinRecords,Welcome To Mavin Records: Crayon,"Don Jazzy’s Mavin Records Signs New Artist Crayon; launches BLOWTIME imprint with Producer Baby Fresh

Mavin Records announces the signing of Crayon, the first artist signed to Baby Fresh’s Blowtime Entertainment record label imprint. Crayon’s innovative music blends global pop, local Afrobeats, Latin and Caribbean rhythms for a dynamic new sound with mass appeal.


“We are pleased to announce our new imprint deal with Baby Fresh's Blowtime Entertainment as we unveil our new artist, Crayon. Baby Fresh has always been part of the Mavin family and we look forward to what is shaping up to be a remarkable stage of his amazing career. Crayon is an exceptional songwriter and recording artist who comes with a lot of diversity in his music and I am sure that we will attain great things together,” said Don Jazzy, Mavin’s founder and President.

“Crayon is a bundle of talent and creating this imprint with Baby Fresh is part of our objective to deliver dynamic growth for our artists. Our ambition is to help talent achieve their musical and entrepreneurial goals with our infrastructure, unique experience and diverse team. This kind of collaboration is vital for the growth of our industry,” said Mavin’s COO, Tega Oghenejobo.

Crayon grew up in Iba, Lagos, filling notebooks with lyrics and jumping at the first chance he got to record in a studio, where he met his friend and collaborator Ozedikus. By chance, Baby Fresh heard one of those early songs and instantly knew Crayon had potential to become the new face and voice of Afrobeats. 

“He’s called Crayon because his work is so colorful: it channels Fela, Drake, Justin Bieber, Bryson Tiller, Wizkid and Davido in a way that feels completely current and fresh. I was on the lookout for a new artist to take Afrobeats somewhere newer and bigger, and that’s what I found in him,” Baby Fresh said. 

“I want to put my community on the map. I’ll be the first artist to really break out of Iba, and that means a lot to me. When I started making music I was just a kid. I’m crazy excited to share my music and be part of this moment when Afrobeats are going global,” Crayon said. 

Crayon will be featured on several upcoming releases from fellow Mavins and his own EP will debut this summer. Follow him on Instagram at @crayonthis and follow @mavinrecords for updates on new releases and signings.",2019-05-31 10:30:14,47699,864,0,49,PT58S,hd,false,1900-01-01 10:30:14,2019,May,Friday,2019-05-31,58.0

o-lPWcRFxPo,MavinRecords,Welcome Rema,"Mavin Records and Jonzing World present the breakthrough teenage artist Rema, unveiling his debut EP 'Rema' - packed with infectious afrobeat grooves and released via Mavin Records as part of their first imprint deal.

Rema is a fantastic example of the strength of talent currently emerging from Africa, with 'Iron Man' a superb introduction that is likely to gain him many plaudits. His ability to confidently navigate his way throughout the project belies his 18 years, merely scratching the surface of his undoubted potential.

“Rema is a formidable young artist: with his skill and versatility, he has a unique place in the future of afrobeats. At the same time, we’re excited to launch our first imprint deal with Jonzing World. This model will expand the number of ways the Mavin platform can support artists and entrepreneurship in Africa to grow together, at home and internationally, ” said D on Jazzy, Mavin Global President.

The Nigerian artist honed his musical skills and individual sound in church and in the playgrounds of Benin City as a young teen, often drawing crowds that were willing to pay to see him perform popular songs. Since then, with the help of Mavin Global & Jonzing World, his reputation has grown and that's likely to be the case for years to come, with label head & visionary Don Jazzy also aiding the careers of Tiwa Savage, Korede Bello, Dr Sid, Johnny Drille, Di'Ja, D'Prince, LADIPOE, DJ Big N and DNA through their work with Mavin.

Rema himself believes ""It still feels like a blessing to be chosen for something great, something beyond this world” as he aims to inspire other young people through his music.

'Rema' is available now on all streaming platform at http://bit.ly/rema-is-on

Aye, yah , aye, aye
Screw you
I love you 
Screw you
With my heart and my soul
I look in your eyes
And the way that I feel
Girl I can’t deny 
With my gang and my thugs 
We live in the wild 
Girl I sent a lot of texts 
But you don’t reply 
Why, yaiy’ 
I just wonder why x2
And I traveled miles
Damn girl you know I traveled miles
I want you in my life girl I want you In my life
Even if it’s for a little while 
I wanna see you smile girl I wanna see you smile 
See you smile yah’ For a while yah’ 
Can you try yah’  Hold you tight

 Yah aye, I say hi
Aye, She say who you is? 
Aye, I say Remyboy Ooh’
she say we don’t fit aye’
Girl give me a chance aye’
Cause I don’t post for the gram aye’ 
I know I wasn’t in school Ooh’ 
She be like what do you do? Yah! 
You ain’t got no cash aye’
You look so so razz aye’
I’m not your type aye’

Damn I almost cried aye’
I know you are hard to get and I’m not the one 
I know you will find me when I’m moving on
And because I had no cash and I wasn’t cool
And you treated me so bad I felt like a fool
Why’ yaiy’
I wish she was mine x3 

With my heart and my soul
I look in your eyes
And the way that I feel
Girl I can’t deny 
With my gang and my thugs 
We live in the wild 
Girl I sent a lot of texts 
But you don’t reply 
Why, yaiy’ 
I just wonder why x2
And I traveled miles
Damn girl you know I traveled miles
I want you in my life girl I want you In my life

This collaboration was a long time coming between the Mavin superstar and DMW superstar.

Davido's rise to fame was inspired partly by the legendary hits of D'Prince such as Give It To Me and Take Banana.

The admiration and respect both artists have for each other led to their first collaboration in 2014 titled Gentlemen, produced by Don Jazzy.

In 2017, both artists saw active campaigns with D’Prince releasing song that included So Nice ft. Wizkid, Guys and Sade while Davido released songs that included IF, Fall and FIA. As both artists embark on their 2018 campaigns,  Gucci Gang will sure be one of the key songs for both artists.",2018-02-16 11:33:07,127841,1703,0,139,PT3M46S,hd,false,1900-01-01 11:33:07,2018,February,Friday,2018-02-16,226.0

-8PmVozG7eY,MavinRecords,D'Prince - OYO ( On Your Own ),"In a world of 7.2 billion people, a league of united nations and powerful government organizations, D'Prince takes a stab at reality with a simple message ""You are on your own"". 
Arguably one of Don Jazzy's finest production yet. O.Y.O (On Your Own) is a brand new Afrobeat inspired single from D'Prince.

O.Y.O is a wake up call to each and every one of us who have grown comfortable with the idea of building our personal hustle around other people who are occupied with their own hustle; it's time to start fighting for yourself.

In many ways O.Y.O is also a warning to those few among us who hardly care about the rest of us; when the proverbial shit hits the fan (as it usually does), you my dear will be packing it on your own. Enjoy!

5piUOVdEFOU,MavinRecords,Industry Nite With The Mavins,"Lagos came to a standstill on Wednesday night as the Mavins shut down Industry Nite. A jam-packed Oriental Hotel played host to hundreds of fans and celebrities who all came to see the Mavins perform together for the first time. And what a performance it was! Wande Coal, Tiwa Savage, Dr.Sid, D' Prince and Don Jazzy all took turns to individually and collectively wow the crowd .

The Mavins performance was the climax of a night that saw other artists such as Segun and Yemi Alade take to the stage. There was also a joint performance between Tunde Ednut and Dr.Sid for 'Catching Cold' which brought the house down. It was a night full of light hearted fun with even Don Jazzy taking to the stage to do the Azonto with Wande Coal. The Mavin crew thanked all their fans who were able to make it and promised that there is much more to come from the label.
